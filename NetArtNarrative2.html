	    	<p>Everything on the web is both non existant, yet physical in some form. In the simplest explanations, it is the sequences of certains electrical pulses that form the very text you are able to see and read right now. </p>
	    	<br>
	    	<p>There is nothing alive on the internet. It is impossible. The only thing that can be recognizable is if we were to code an artificial intelligence to mimic life in the physical world.</p>
	    	<p> What if we let loose that AI, what would it be able to "see"? What would it "feel?" I'm not speaking on a literal level, I'm asking that if it were able to "live" within the code's parameters, what stops it from percieving something that is on the same plane of existence for it? 
	    	<br>
	    	If it was browswer based would the AI feel refreshes on your browser as simple a blink of an eye, or would everything it knew, be destroyed in milliseconds and rebuilt right in front you?
	    	<p>Click this button again and everything will be destroyed and created anew.</p>
