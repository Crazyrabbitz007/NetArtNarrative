	    	<p>Of course, that's not what's happening here. I've just coded buttons that would link you to a new page you're currently on. As humans we like to personify things
	    	that we can empathize to.

	    	<br>
	    	<p>Yet I've changed the meaning of that to you now. Even if you were to not agree with anything I just said, these simple words on the computer screen has convinced you to make an opinion. It has caused you to think, and decide whether or not to feel. </p>
